Code Refactor

    This assignment involved changing impractical code, and adding to it so that it is more accessible, and completely functional.
As such, <div> tags were changed to better suit their given purpose(semantic html), and were also given unique classes and id's to organize and structure the code.
For example, the <div> tag on line 13, and line 25 were changed to a <nav> tag.
Other changes were made, such as adding 'alt' attributes to the images for accessibility, heading tags were ordered numerically, and a title element was added.
